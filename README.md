# Eyes disease

## Introducion
We have developed a desktop application that allows a healthcare professional to diagnose eye diseases using a pre-trained Deep Learning model and a fundus image.

## Objective

- Classify eye diseases to facilitate their diagnosis by ophthalmologists
- Detection and classification are performed by a Deep Learning model pre-trained with annotated medical images

## Model Choice 

The choice of the model came from a thoughtful comparison and an analysis of 3 pre-trained models : VGG16, ResNet50 and InceptionV3
 - The final model chosen was InceptionV3 with an accuracy of 92%
